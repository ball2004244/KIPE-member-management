# Managenent System in Practice

## Description
The folder production contains the final version of the program. It contains the client-side application and the server-side application that are already configurated to communicate via the internet. 

The client-side application is a desktop application that can be run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. It provides a  lightweight application and friendly UI. 

The server-side application is a HTTP server that is hosted at http://kipevietnam.com/hr_server. The code is completely changed from the testing version, by taking into account WGSI (Web Server Gateway Interface) logic and syntax.
